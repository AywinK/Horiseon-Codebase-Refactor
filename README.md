# Horiseon Codebase Refactor

## Description
This project is undertaken to improve the codebase of an existing site for a marketing agency without any changes to the webpage appearance or function. The agency wants the site to follow accessibility standards, so that the site's rankings on search engines is optimised.

Improvements to the site are achieved in this project by:
- Use of semantic HTML elements
- Bettering the HTML and CSS file structure including comments
- Adding `<alt>` attributes to all images and icons
- Addition of a well suited webpage title within the `<title>` tag
- Fixing navigation links
